## üö® Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and have fallback plans
- **Scalability**: Design with horizontal scaling in mind
- **Security**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined features for initial release
- **Timeline Delays**: Build buffer time into each phase
- **Resource Availability**: Have backup plans for key team members
- **Quality Assurance**: Don't compromise testing for speed
